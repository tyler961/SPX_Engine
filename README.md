# SPX_Vulkan_Renderer

SPX Vulkan Renderer

Currently the goals of this project is a simple 3D viewer with camera capabilities using the Vulkan API that I've abstracted into a wrapper.
This project is to teach me the flow of a graphics pipeline and the use of the Vulkan API and increase my knowledge of the C++ standard library and how it can be used.
This is also teaching me software architecture for a large project.


After the current goal is met, I plan to add onto it and increasing its functionality beyond a Renderer wrapper.
