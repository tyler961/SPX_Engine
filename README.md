## This is a work in progress!!

SPX Vulkan Renderer

Currently the goals of this project is a simple 3D viewer with camera capabilities using the Vulkan API that I've abstracted into a wrapper.
This project is to teach me the flow of a graphics pipeline and the use of the Vulkan API and increase my knowledge of the C++ standard library and how it can be used.
This is also teaching me software architecture for a large project.


After the current goal is met, I plan to add onto it and increasing its functionality beyond a Renderer wrapper.

Currently the wrapper can render two seperate models and apply textures (with lighting baked in) to those models.

In order to run the code, you will need to download and install the Vulkan SDK.
